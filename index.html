					<h2>What is this?</h2>
					<p>If you are completely clueless, chances are you are not familiar with the Irish educational system, so here's a brief overview.</p>
					<p>In Ireland, like in most countries, Secondary school (equivalent of US "Middle School") students have to take final exams. In Ireland, these exams are called the "Leaving Certificate".</p>
					<p>Through a complex system of grading and calculations, your Leaving Cert results are converted into a single number, which can range from 0 to 625. This number is what most third level colleges and universities look at as an entry requirement.</p>
					<p>There is just under 60 different subjects you can choose to do for your Leaving Cert, depending on your school. Most of these subjects have two difficulty levels; Higher and Ordinary, with 8 grades for each level.</p>
					<p>Each level and grade contributes a different amount of points (more information <a href="#grade-reference">here</a>), which are all added up into the single number. You can choose to do however many subjects you want, but only your best six results will count towards the total.</p>
					<p>However, some subjects are exceptions and are calculated differently. When developing this calculator, I made sure to account for all such exceptions. Please let me know if I missed anything.</p>
					<h2>How is this better than other calculators?</h2>
					<p>Inspiration for this project came to me when I hit "START OVER" for the 20th time on the CareersPortal calculator. Just wanting to check how much worse my result would be if I got a H3 instead of a H2 in one subject, I had to enter all of my results again.</p>
					<p>I imagined a similar calculator, but which remembered all of your subjects, and updated in real time to show your point total, without the need to re-enter all grades every single time.</p>
					<p>Although the Qualifax calculator does allow for changes without restarting, it is horribly non-mobile friendly, and requires a page refresh to recalculate, so it isn't really "real time".</p>
					<p>That evening, I already had a working prototype, and the next day my calculator was mostly finished.</p>
					<p>Here are links to the other calculators, so you can compare for yourself:</p>

						<li><a href="https://www.qualifax.ie/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=305" target="_blank">Qualifax Leaving Cert Points Calculator</a></li>

					</ul>
					<p>This calculator works great on both desktop and mobile, mouse or touch screen. It features a modern UI with automatic dark theme.</p>
					<p>Your subjects and grades are remebered, which means that if you ever return to this website, everything will be just as you left it.</p>
					<h2>Technical details</h2>
					<p>All data is stored and calculated exclusively in your browser, and is at no point sent to any remote server. Subjects and grades are saved in the browser's LocalStorage.</p>
					<p>I decided to develop this project as a single HTML file, which allows you to easily download it (Ctrl+S) for offline use.</p>
					<h2>Support me</h2>
					<p>I developed this project with no monetary goals in mind, and I would never want to charge people to use it, or put ads on it.</p>
					<p>However, I would be absolutely delighted if you checked out some of my <a href="https://tikolu.net" target="_blank">other projects</a>, and if you are feeling particularly generous, you can <a href="https://paypal.me/tikolu" target="_blank">donate</a>.</p>
					<p>If there is anything you would like me to add or change about my calculator, or if you simply want to have a chat, don't hesitate to <a href="https://tikolu.net/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a>.</p>
